# Mentorship 2 (Functional Programming Baby Steps through Haskell)

This mentorship is focused on learning the very basics of Haskell. There are "TODOs " where the mentee is expected to work on.


### Requirements

An installation of stack is needed. Further reference on: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

### Installation

After cloning this repository, the mentee should run the following:
```sh
$ stack setup
$ stack install
$ stack exec m2-exe

```
In order to run the project.

### Work

The mentee is expected to fill the `TODO: ` marks accordingly to the function.

### Test

The execution of the following command should run successfully after the mentee has replaced the "TODOs ".
```sh
$ stack test
